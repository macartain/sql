REM   Filename:  PinnedCode.sql
REM
REM   This query will show you memory requirements of the 'pinned' 
REM   code in your database.    If you need to 'pin' many objects in the
REM   Shared Pool, Oracle recommends you determine the memory 
REM   allocated for these objects and increase the Shared Pool to
REM   accommodate the 'pinned' objects without impacting other 
REM   memory allocations over time.     
REM
REM   NOTE:  Some ORA-4031 issues can be narrowed to cases 
REM   where 100s or 1000s of objects are 'pinned' in the Shared 
REM   Pool over time, but no increases to the size of the Shared 
REM   Pool were implemented as well.
