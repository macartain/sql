REM 
REM   Investigate memory chunk stress in the Shared Pool
REM   It is safe to run these queries as often as you like.    
REM   Large memory misses in the Shared Pool
REM   will be attemped in the Reserved Area.    Another 
REM   failure in the Reserved Area causes an 4031 error
REM
REM   What should you look for?
REM   Reserved Pool Misses = 0 can mean the Reserved 
REM   Area is too big.  Reserved Pool Misses always increasing
REM   but "4031's" not increasing can mean the Reserved Area 
REM   is too small.  In this case flushes in the Shared Pool
REM   satisfied the memory needs and a 4031 was not actually
REM   reported to the user.  Reserved Pool Misses and "4031's"
REM   always increasing can mean the Reserved Area is too
REM   small and flushes  in the Shared Pool are not helping
REM   (likely got an ORA-04031).
